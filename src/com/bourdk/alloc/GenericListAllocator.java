/**
 * A class that allocates some amount of randomized List data given a type.
 * 
 * Since generics yield themselves well to implementations that allow element and structure access
 * rather than manipulation (removal/deletion also OK), they are suitable to test behaviour and
 * performance of large collections using allocation, access, and, in some cases, removal.
